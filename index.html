                <p>For the last 7 years I've taken on dozens of WordPress/Bespoke websites in my down-time and I've been involved in the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Integrating different currencies across a website</li>
                    <li>Bespoke user input on eCommerce sites to allow customers to personalise their product on-the-fly</li>
                    <li>Custom pricing depending on user "level" - allowing long-term trade customers to pay lower prices with no change in UX</li>
                    <li>Various websites that were previously desktop-only to tablet and mobile forms</li>
                    <li>Web scraping to assess if competitors currently had items on a sale, or were out of stock on items</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>G4S</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Processing of offline data using OCR and Python to sort, rename, thousands of files in one go</li>
                    <li>Previous developers claimed "it could not be done" as the documents weren't currently parseable</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>www.hotel-ware.co.uk group</strong> (5 years maintenance and additions)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintaining hotel-ware.co.uk and sister (non-trade) websites that each had 20,000+ products. </li>

                </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <li>Employee Holiday management system build with Laravel and VueJS</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Allowed employees to request holiday days, auto-rejections under certain conditions</li>
                        <li>Highly complicated scenarios ensured enough staff were always present</li>

                <p><strong>UltiMobile LLC</strong> Contracted developer November 2014 - April 2016</p>
                <p>Tasked in developing custom Android firmware for various US Carriers.</p>
                <p>The role developed into me creating several internal applications (mostly inventory and project tracking systems). I managed to condense 4 fragmented (and rather old) web applications into 1, which was used by the internal developers as well as potential clients to assess how UltiMobile could help their development needs). I created several websites for the public, for which I was mostly asked to use the Wordpress CMS so that the team in America could update the content regularly without my help. </p>

                <p><strong>Websell Masters LTD</strong> Part-time developer (February 2014 - October 2014)</p>
                <p>This part-time job entailed creating new websites for clients as well as amending existing ones. I instigated the start of building responsive websites for tablets and phones in order to keep up with competitors (and take advantage of the new “phablet” hardware). The largest project I took on was http://www.showquest.co.uk which I did alongside another developer. The http://showquest.co.uk/bespoke-browband-maker/ page of the website is a fully customised browband creator using sophisticated jQuery for a fluid, personalised experience. It took a lot of ingenuity and cups of coffee to complete, as it'd the only type of it's kind (that we knew of) in the world.</p>
